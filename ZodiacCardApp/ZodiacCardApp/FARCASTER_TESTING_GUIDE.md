# Farcaster Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the ZodiacCards app in both web browser and Farcaster environments.

## ‚úÖ Full Upgrade Complete

The app has been upgraded from `@farcaster/frame-sdk` to `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk` with the following improvements:

### What Changed

1. **SDK Packages** ‚úÖ
   - `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk@0.2.1` (was `@farcaster/frame-sdk@0.0.34`)
   - `@farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector@1.1.0` (new)

2. **Enhanced SDK Initializer** ‚úÖ ([sdk-initializer.tsx](components/sdk-initializer.tsx))
   - 3-method environment detection (isInMiniApp, context validation, user agent)
   - 3-second global timeout with fallback
   - 2-second per-step timeouts
   - Step-by-step progress tracking
   - Detailed console logging with timestamps
   - Development mode debug indicator
   - Smart `ready()` call only in Farcaster environment

3. **Farcaster Context Provider** ‚úÖ ([FarcasterContext.tsx](contexts/FarcasterContext.tsx))
   - Auto-authentication on mount
   - User data extraction (fid, username, displayName, pfpUrl, addresses)
   - Global user state management
   - Graceful fallback for non-Farcaster environments

4. **Updated Wagmi Configuration** ‚úÖ ([wagmi.ts](lib/wagmi.ts))
   - Using `farcasterMiniApp()` connector (was `farcasterFrame`)
   - Multi-chain support maintained (Celo + Base)

5. **Smart Connect Menu** ‚úÖ ([connect-menu.tsx](components/connect-menu.tsx))
   - Auto-connect in Farcaster environment
   - Detects Farcaster context and connects automatically
   - Manual connect for web users
   - Proper connector selection based on environment

6. **App Layout Integration** ‚úÖ ([layout.tsx](app/layout.tsx))
   - FarcasterProvider wraps the entire application
   - Proper provider nesting order

## Testing in Web Browser

### Expected Behavior

When you open the app in a regular web browser:

1. **Environment Detection**:
   - Console logs: `üìç SDK INITIALIZATION: Not in Farcaster environment, skipping ready() call`
   - SDK initializer step: `skipped-not-farcaster`

2. **User Authentication**:
   - FarcasterContext will not have user data
   - `isAuthenticated` will be `false`

3. **Wallet Connection**:
   - No auto-connect
   - User must manually click "Connect Wallet"
   - Will use WalletConnect or injected wallet (MetaMask, etc.)

### Steps to Test

```bash
cd ZodiacCardApp
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and:

1. ‚úÖ Check browser console for SDK initialization logs
2. ‚úÖ Verify no Farcaster user data in console
3. ‚úÖ Click "Connect Wallet" button
4. ‚úÖ Connect with WalletConnect or MetaMask
5. ‚úÖ Verify wallet connects successfully
6. ‚úÖ Test minting a Zodiac Card

## Testing in Farcaster

### Expected Behavior

When the app runs in Farcaster mobile app or as a Mini App:

1. **Environment Detection**:
   - Console logs: `‚úÖ SDK INITIALIZATION: Context retrieved successfully`
   - Console logs: `üîç SDK INITIALIZATION: Environment validation` with `finalResult: true`
   - Console logs: `‚úÖ SDK INITIALIZATION: ready() call completed successfully!`
   - SDK initializer step: `complete`

2. **User Authentication**:
   - FarcasterContext automatically authenticates
   - Console logs: `‚úÖ Farcaster user created:` with user data
   - User object contains: fid, username, displayName, pfpUrl, addresses

3. **Wallet Connection**:
   - Automatic wallet connection
   - Console logs: `üîó Auto-connecting Farcaster wallet...`
   - Console logs: `‚úÖ Auto-connected successfully`
   - No manual "Connect Wallet" click needed

### Steps to Test

1. **Deploy to a Public URL**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your hosting service
   ```

2. **Create Farcaster Frame**:
   - Update your Frame metadata with the deployed URL
   - The app already has Frame metadata in `layout.tsx`

3. **Test in Farcaster Mobile App**:
   - Open Farcaster mobile app
   - Navigate to your Frame/Mini App
   - Watch for auto-authentication
   - Watch for auto-wallet connection
   - Test minting a Zodiac Card

## Console Log Reference

### Successful Farcaster Initialization

```
[timestamp] üöÄ SDK INITIALIZATION: Starting process...
[timestamp] üåç SDK INITIALIZATION: Environment details
[timestamp] ‚è∞ SDK INITIALIZATION: Starting after DOM ready delay
[timestamp] üì± SDK INITIALIZATION: Step 1 - Getting SDK context...
[timestamp] ‚úÖ SDK INITIALIZATION: Context retrieved successfully
[timestamp] üîç SDK INITIALIZATION: Environment validation
[timestamp] üìû SDK INITIALIZATION: Step 3 - Calling sdk.actions.ready()...
[timestamp] ‚úÖ SDK INITIALIZATION: ready() call completed successfully!
[timestamp] üéâ SDK INITIALIZATION: Complete - SDK ready and splash screen should be hidden
```

### Successful Farcaster Authentication

```
üîê Attempting to get Farcaster context...
üì± SDK context: {user: {...}, client: {...}}
‚úÖ Farcaster user created: {fid: 123456, username: "...", ...}
```

### Successful Auto-Connect

```
üîó Auto-connecting Farcaster wallet...
‚úÖ Auto-connected successfully
```

### Web Browser (Non-Farcaster)

```
[timestamp] üìç SDK INITIALIZATION: Not in Farcaster environment, skipping ready() call
```

## Debugging

### If SDK Initialization Fails

1. Check console for timeout messages
2. Verify you're in Farcaster environment
3. Check network connectivity
4. Review detailed error logs with stack traces

### If Auto-Connect Fails

1. Verify FarcasterContext has authenticated user
2. Check that `farcasterMiniApp` connector is available
3. Review console logs for connection errors
4. Ensure proper provider nesting in layout.tsx

### Development Mode Debug Indicator

When running in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`), you'll see a debug indicator in the top-left corner showing:
- Current initialization step
- Any errors that occur
- Waiting status

This is automatically hidden in production.

## Benefits of This Upgrade

1. **Robust Environment Detection**: 3 independent checks ensure accurate Farcaster detection
2. **Improved User Experience**: Auto-authentication and auto-connect in Farcaster
3. **Better Error Handling**: Timeout mechanisms prevent hanging initialization
4. **Detailed Logging**: Timestamp-based logs make debugging easier
5. **Modern SDK**: Using latest Farcaster Mini App SDK with better support
6. **Graceful Fallbacks**: App works perfectly in both Farcaster and web environments

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test in local development browser
2. ‚úÖ Deploy to production environment
3. ‚úÖ Test in Farcaster mobile app
4. ‚úÖ Monitor console logs for any issues
5. ‚úÖ Verify auto-authentication works
6. ‚úÖ Verify auto-wallet connection works
7. ‚úÖ Test complete NFT minting flow
